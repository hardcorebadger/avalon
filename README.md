## The Vision

Avalon’s purpose is to organically create a player driven economic and geopolitical simulation in a super-massive, persistent, multiplayer world. The world will be finite in space, resources, and so forth, and will begin as a completely uninhabited map about the size of the United Kingdom. Using simple mechanics, players will guide their house from simple nomadism to full-blown multi-city nations involved in complex international trade and politics. Avalon is more than a game - it’s a massive community experiment in what a simulated civilization is capable of creating. Everything is player created, there’s no quest to endure other than the one which leads your house to its ultimate potential in the collectively imagined society that dwells in the continent of Avalon.

## How It Works

Players are given a few villagers to guide from a top-down perspective. These villagers must eat, drink, and ultimately, reproduce. Players will guide their subjects through the process of gathering resources, constructing a town, and finally specializing and maturing into a trade-based economy. The mechanics of the game will more or less require cooperation and specialization of job types, thereby incentivizing local trade. From here, many upper-tier resources will be unevenly distributed throughout the larger continent, thus eventually requiring the coordination of long-distance trade.

Keeping villagers alive is easy, building a town is easy, coordinating trade is not easy - and developers will work hand-in-hand with the community to discuss and implement features that may be deemed required in order to facilitate this endeavor. Avalon is not a game tossed at players - it is an experiment in which a tight community shares the lofty goal of simulating a new civilization, and they work hard to develop a game that fits their purpose. Years have been spent developing the mechanics and rule-set currently under implementation, but new directions and options will never be disregarded by the developers if they are proposed and underwritten by an invested community of players who want to make this dream come true.
