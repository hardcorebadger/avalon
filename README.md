## The Vision

Avalon’s purpose is to organically create a player driven economic and geopolitical simulation in a super-massive, persistent, multiplayer world. The world will be finite in space, resources, and so forth, and will begin as a completely uninhabited map about the size of the United Kingdom. Using simple mechanics, players will guide their house from simple nomadism to full-blown multi-city nations involved in complex international trade and politics. Avalon is more than a game - it’s a massive community experiment in what a simulated civilization is capable of creating. Everything is player created, there’s no quest to endure other than the one which leads your house to its ultimate potential in the collectively imagined society that dwells in the continent of Avalon.

## How It Works

Players are given a few villagers to guide from a top-down perspective. These villagers must eat, drink, and ultimately, reproduce. Being in a massively multiplayer world, there's really no guaruntees past this. With mechanics for combat, political alliances / banners, defenses, technological advancement, specialization / comparative advantage, and resource distribution - (and that's pretty much the MVP in a sentence) we have been led by deduction and speculation to believe that a civilization will arise. This means you could spawn on an undiscovered shore of a vast new world, behloden to you for exploration. You could spawn in a bustling trade hub, get your avalonians employed at the nearest business to train and build wealth, only to eventually monopolize the market for yourself and become a financial world-power. You could immediately run to an island and take refuge with raiders, making a living intercepting shipments between two powerful nations. Of course, you could start a settlement and join banners with others to form a nation imbued with a destiny of conquest. Hell, you could just make money and explore this amazingly intricate system which has been developed by the will of your fellow players.

## Civilization Development Framework

We've developed a theoretical framework which describes how we believe civilization will develop using these mechanics - in case you don't believe us, here it is:

1. Self-Sustaining Colonization: Players each playing individually with no cooperation, mining, logging, and farming, building up defenses and often raiding eachother

2. Need for Safety Causes Alliances: Due to the superiority of numbers, offline protection, and elimination of potential enemies, city-states will form alliances - these alliances will allow for and develop internal trade systems which serve to expediate specialization and thereby technological advancement

3. Arms Race Causes Resource-Led Colonization: Driven by an ever-present need to out-defend and militarize national enemies, technology advancements will yield units and building types requiring often far-away resources - this need will cause either individual euntreprenuers or nations themselves to establish colonies in these not-so-inhabitable places to mine resources - thereby establishing the first long-distance trade networks

4. Trade-enabled Food Distribution Causes Non-Farming Free-Holds: Enabled by the new food-resource trades in frontier,previously uninhabitable places, pioneers will begin settling these last frontiers under their own banners, trading with the colonial towns for food. Eventually their centralized control will outpace the colonial settlements on resource production, leading to trade being more beneficial than actual resource mining for the larger colonial empires, and the first non-farming nations will begin - entirely reliant on trade for survival.

5. Full Saturation: This stage is defined by the world comming to be fully explored, developed, and incorporated into the global system. Once this happens, goals begin to shift. Rather than an arms race via resoruces, nations will compete based on technology, and instead of fighting for land, they will be fighting for resources. Overspreading of some countries will cause internal disputes and eventually lead to new countries developing. Many players may take to raiding in the general unrest. Euntreprenurial players will be tasked with thinking up new services to offer such as character trading, trade route fortification, and escort groups. This period is characterized by general unrest and upheaval.

6. Stabalization: Eventually the unrest settles into stalemates and a hyper-developed global system. New population slows down and eventually halts and new players chose to start characters in different worlds due to opportunity. Players use money to explore the infinitely complex world they have developed and to grow their power in it. History is written, an identity as a civilization develops.
